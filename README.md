# **AI-Driven Energy Optimization Project**

This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of AI and data science techniques for energy optimization in power plant operations. Inspired by the McKinsey and Vistra Corp. case study, this project demonstrates how advanced analytics and machine learning can drive efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance sustainability in the energy sector.

## **Project Overview**

This project showcases a step-by-step solution for deploying AI models to:
1. **Optimize Heat Rates**: Improve thermal efficiency using a Neural Network-based regression model.
2. **Detect Anomalies**: Use Isolation Forest for identifying potential equipment failures.
3. **Monitor Emissions**: Apply Random Forest for real-time classification of emissions and reduction strategies.

The dataset includes simulated power plant operational data, and the models are trained, validated, and deployed using industry-standard tools and practices.
